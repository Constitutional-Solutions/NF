# Expansion Checklist (Approved)

This checklist captures all approved expansion paths and radical ideas. Items are ordered by
implementation priority (P0 highest).

## P0 — Immediate Foundations
- [x] Pattern-math layer integrated into the kernel.
- [x] Optional-dependency handling and core runtime guards.
- [x] Expansion scaffolds: bio-unification math + compassion watchdog.
- [x] JSON diagnostics snapshots with versioned schema. (Current: `diagnostics/latest.json`)
- [x] Pattern registry with metadata (intent, invariants, constraints).

## P1 — Core System Enhancements
- [x] Driver interface for nervous system I/O (pluggable backends). (Current: HTTP driver)
- [x] Pattern-tagged routing outputs (attach transformation descriptors to routes).
- [x] Unified ontology spec for all layers and symbolic contracts. (Draft: `docs/expansions/ontology.md`)
- [x] Mycelial routing stress simulator with bio-harmonic annotations.
