# Unified Ontology Spec (Draft)

This document captures the symbolic contracts that bind the Genesis Kernel layers.

## Layer Contracts

- **Axioms**: numeric constants and derived ratios (source of truth).
- **Forces**: operators that transform relationships (resonance, coherence, attraction).
- **Body**: routing and encoding of bio-inspired state (mycelial patterns).
- **Mind**: quantization and harmonic state estimation.
- **Pattern Math**: variable-less transformation vocabulary.
- **Nervous System**: hardware I/O bridges and driver protocols.
- **Consciousness**: bicameral synthesis and decision boundaries.
- **Awakening**: orchestration, diagnostics, and snapshots.

## Symbol Glossary

- **Pattern**: ordered transformation steps with intent.
- **Property**: invariants such as commutativity or associativity.
- **Mode**: runtime state descriptor (growth, survival, idle).
