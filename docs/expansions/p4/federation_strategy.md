# SDN/libp2p Federation Strategy (Scaffold)

## Goal
Define peer-to-peer federation for 1k+ nodes with SDN overlays.

## Building Blocks
- **libp2p**: peer discovery, secure channels, content routing.
- **SDN controller**: bandwidth shaping and routing policies.
- **Mycelial routing**: stress-aware path selection.

## Next Steps
- Define node roles and trust tiers.
- Document bandwidth caps and fallback behaviors.
