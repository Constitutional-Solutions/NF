# Rust Acceleration Plan (Scaffold)

## Goal
Identify hot paths for Rust migration.

## Candidates
- Bio routing and stress simulation
- Quantum harmonic computations
- Pattern registry serialization

## Approach
- Start with FFI bindings for compute-heavy functions.
- Validate against Python reference outputs.
