We now have a layered kernel with pattern-math primitives, diagnostics snapshots, and expansion
scaffolds spanning P0-P3. The immediate need is to convert these scaffolds into validated
components with clear interfaces, tests, and data contracts so that future expansions (P4 and
radical ideas) can be layered safely. The architecture supports growth; the next step is
formalizing policy, metrics, and deployment guides to keep the system grounded as capabilities
expand.
